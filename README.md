# Smart Meter Image Processing

## Overview
The Smart Meter Image Processing project is designed to analyze images of pressure gauges and extract pressure readings using advanced image processing techniques. This application leverages FastAPI for the backend and utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for object detection and segmentation.

## Features
- **Image Processing**: Processes input images of pressure gauges to extract pressure readings.
- **Model Integration**: Utilizes YOLO for detecting and segmenting gauge regions.
- **Pressure Calculation**: Computes the difference in pressure readings between two images.

## Technologies Used
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision tasks.
- **YOLO**: A state-of-the-art object detection model.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
